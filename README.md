"# project-2-jklebba"   
Sorting, Hashing, and BloomFilter  

In this project I implemented and tested the following functionalities:   
  
-QuickSort (recursive)  
-Binary Search (recursive)  
-Merge Sort (recursive)  
-Hash Function that converts strings or integers to integers  
-Bloom Filter  
  
   
I have provided links in the comments to the places I got help from. 
  
Also special thanks to Dr. Borowczak for assisting me with this project.
